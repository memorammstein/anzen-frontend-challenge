- `/file/:id` (extra):

While documents could be included as direct cdn/storage urls, creating a `files` endpoint could provide some key benefits:
    - Stability: a stable file id and endpoint can be provided, allowing for the actual file location to be updated without requiring resource url validation.
    - Flexibility: custom parameters could be passed down to the endpoint to, for example, configure delivery options.
    - Security: the same auth configuration/middleware setup used for other endpoints could be used here (instead of a separate setup, if required).
- Auth (extra): The provided mockup does not include a header (or any other) section that displays an active user account (session), but considering the data displayed on the main body, it could be assumed that some sort of authentication/authorization middleware would be required for the other endpoints.
