# anzen-frontend-challenge
Author: Guillermo Jimenez

## Reference
Challenge: https://gist.github.com/joseamuniz/c2dced8e82158702f991f71174ebf801

## Implementation
### Requirements
- Quick prototype: Shouldn't take more than a couple hours of development.
- Third-party tools: Any library or framework used should be open source /freely available.
- Responsive design: The page should work well under different viewports, both desktop and mobile.
### Constraints
It is assumed, based on the challenge description, that the final deliverable should be in the form of a single `html` file (mockup is single-page) and one or more `css` files. This means it should be able to be rendered without including any `js` files, or the need of a Javascript runtime at all.
### Options
- Single file static page (selected):
    - Pros: Quickest method to develop. Closest from inception to wanted end result. Fastest to compile and render.
    - Cons: No markup/component modularity/reusability. Functionalities (js) not easily implementable in an scalable way.
- Template Engine-rendered page:
    - Pros: Good middleground between raw html and component-based (easier to translate to the latter). Added development features (conditions, imports, etc.). Can be compiled to no-js target.
    - Cons: Each templating engine has a different syntax (would need to translate back to html/jsx/... if stack is changed). Depending on engine, syntax might be cumbersome to maintain and add attributes/metadata to. In a team, it would be an extra learning curve for many.
- Component-based application:
    - Pros: Modular approach, potentially faster to implement functionalities, existing ecosystems, etc...
    - Cons: No static page target (js required).

        ... //other steps
    ]
}
```
- `/file/:id` (extra):

While documents could be included as direct cdn/storage urls, creating a `files` endpoint could provide some key benefits:
    - Stability: a stable file id and endpoint can be provided, allowing for the actual file location to be updated without requiring resource url validation.
    - Flexibility: custom parameters could be passed down to the endpoint to, for example, configure delivery options.
    - Security: the same auth configuration/middleware setup used for other endpoints could be used here (instead of a separate setup, if required).
- Auth (extra): The provided mockup does not include a header (or any other) section that displays an active user account (session), but considering the data displayed on the main body, it could be assumed that some sort of authentication/authorization middleware would be required for the other endpoints.
